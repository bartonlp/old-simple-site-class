# Old SimpleSiteClass Verion 1.0.0

## This is the old version of SimpleSiteClass that had branches *master* and *pdo*.

The *master* branch has the dbMysqli.class.php. The *pdo* branch has the dbPdo.class.php. This was all merged into
a new *main* branch in the new **SimpleSiteClass** repository at [https://github.com/bartonlp/simple-site-class](https://github.com/bartonlp/simple-site-class).
This repository is just for historical reasons. There is a package on Packagist.com for this repository.
